/**
 * Created by SkinTang on 7/5/17.
 * Intersection:
 * Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
 * Return the interÂ­secting node.
 * Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value.
 * That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is
 * the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list,
 * then they are intersecting.
 *
 * Hints:#20, #45, #55, #65, #76, #93, #111, #120, #129
